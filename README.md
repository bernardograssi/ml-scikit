# Description
This repository contains some projects I have worked in during my Machine Learning class in the Spring of 2021.

# ml-01
Project ml-01 was developed in order to understand how Support Vector Machines work, especially the difference between the various kernels that can be used and the models' parameters. The classifiers used were: Logistic Regression, SGD Classifier, Support Vector Classifier with Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid kernels.
